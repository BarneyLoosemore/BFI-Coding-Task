To run the solution uncomment the lines in `format.ts`, and run `deno run format.ts` (https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/ to install Deno), and run `deno test format_test.ts` to run tests.
You can copy the source of the `format` function and run that elsewhere if you don't want to install Deno - Deno is just my preferred TS runtime for small projects.
